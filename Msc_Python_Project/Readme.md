# MSc Python Programming Assignments

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of four Python programs. These were my MSc projects Python four programs given as an assignment (2021). Each script is designed to solve a specific computational problem, demonstrating fundamental programming principles and the application of scientific computing libraries.

## Scripts Included

### manual_matrix_multiplication.py
This script performs matrix multiplication on two matrices whose dimensions and elements are provided by the user. The core calculation is implemented using a standard algorithm with nested loops.

### student_height_analyzer.py
This program collects the names and heights (in feet and inches) of ten students. It then processes this data to identify the student with the maximum height and to calculate the average height of the group.

### projectile_motion_simulator.py
This script simulates the trajectory of a projectile launched from a specified height at various initial angles. It calculates key physical metrics, including range, time of flight, and maximum height, and generates a comparative plot of the trajectories.

### mandelbrot_set_plotter.py
This program generates and plots a visual representation of the Mandelbrot set. It achieves this by iterating a function over a grid of points in the complex plane and testing for boundedness.

## System Requirements

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Installation

To run these scripts, the required third-party libraries can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
